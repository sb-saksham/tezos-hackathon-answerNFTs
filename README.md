My Journey:

I was excited about this hackathon and have seen a previous hackathon organized by the tezos community but wasn't able to participate in it due to a lack of Tezos smart-contract development knowledge. As soon as I got to know about this hackathon I started learning about tezos smart contracts and LIGO. I learned LIGO from "tacode.dev" which is a very helpful and comprehensive resource. Also, I got loads of help from the discord community made for this Hackathon. Even if I do not win this hackathon, I would be grateful to the whole Tezos community for this immensely great experience of development on Tezos Blockchain. The ecosystem of development is very helpful and engaging. I am in college first year and this hackathon would greatly help me advance my experience in the Web3 and the Blockchain Development field.
